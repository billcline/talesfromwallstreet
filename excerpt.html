            <h2>The Wall Street Fast Lane</h2>

            <p>No matter what you read or saw in movies about Wall Street in the '80s and '90s it was much wilder than
                that. Weed and cocaine were everywhere and like alcohol often part of the business day, a business deal,
                or after work entertainment. But it was also a period of transformational innovation and market
                disruption. Fortunes were made, some were lost, and an entire ecosystem of products, services, and
                businesses fed off the financial largesse of Wall Street fueled by digital transformation of trading
                systems, market data, and exchanges. Exclusive and expensive clubs, bars, restaurants, and luxury real
                estate, jewelry, clothing, and car retailers spent all year cultivating relationships with superstar
                traders and senior financial industry executives.</p>

            <p>Like hungry western bears eagerly awaiting the all-you-can-eat buffet of the annual salmon migration
                everybody on and around Wall Street counted down the days to awards of 6, 7, and 8 figure bonuses at big
                investment banks and funds. Financial beneficiaries extended well beyond traders and top executives to
                include IT and software professionals developing the advanced technology, applications, and algorithms
                that made everything possible. It included operations staff that kept ever larger and more complex
                trades flowing smoothly while maintaining real-time trading positions, risk exposure, P&L summaries, and
                appeasing regulators.</p>

            <p>There were plenty of trading and investment management profits to go around on Wall Street during these
                years, and the often life changing bonuses were expected by Wall Street professionals at all levels. For
                many the annual bonus was larger than their guaranteed yearly salary, the size correlated to measurable
                performance excellence in someone’s given role. Artificial preferences regardless of ostensible
                justification were unheard of, and excuses didn’t work on Wall Street or at the vendors and big
                consulting firms serving the financial services industry.</p>

            <p>Bonuses were sometimes expected by employees who thought they were better than they were but they usually
                weren’t around very long. Wall Street ran on numbers, and tangible performance results were all that
                mattered for compensation and promotion decisions. Performance could mean trading profits for a trader,
                returns for an investment manager, or trade processing speed and operational efficiency in the middle
                and back office. Getting a smaller than expected bonus disappointed people, but most accepted the need
                to improve their performance relative to peers. If someone received no bonus in a given year it was a
                message to quickly improve or call your favorite headhunter. No bonus was usually a precursor to
                termination as part of the yearly culling of the bottom 10+% of performers.</p>

            <p>Wall Street high performance culture was survival of the most deserving, and the preference-free pursuit
                and rewards of high-performance produced superior business outcomes and happier, more productive
                employees. If you performed well on Wall Street your job was secure and you made a lot of money. Nobody
                cared about race, color, nationality, sex, gender, academic credentials, politics, or who somebody slept
                with. A transparent meritocracy seemed fairer than artificial preferences giving unearned advantages to
                some while disadvantaging others, leaving proponents to justify why, for how long, to what degree, and
                for what groups in what proportions.</p>

            <p>Wall Street employees at all levels were very well compensated, but so were the hardware, software,
                application, data, and services vendors that created, developed, sold, and delivered capital markets
                innovation making lucrative profits possible. My early work moved market data and analytics from
                stand-alone terminals into integrated video switching systems. Then they were made obsolete when we
                introduced digital trading systems, high speed networks, real-time data, application software, and
                algorithms. Digital disruption was worldwide, changing the capital markets industry landscape and
                resetting the definition of winners and losers.</p>

            <p>As a young trader I had telephone handsets in both hands while “squawk boxes” streamed live trade talk
                from market makers and I obsessed over stacks of computer screens. The cacophony of noise on a big
                trading floor with thousands of traders was overwhelming to outsiders. Special acoustic treatments made
                sure shouting on the trading floor could be heard by traders across the room, specialized lighting
                minimized screen glare, and customized HVAC systems dissipated heat from thousands of traders and
                computer screens in a confined space.</p>

            <p>I wrote paper trade tickets by hand before giving them to others who manually entered data into a trade
                processing system off the trading floor. As I learned more about technology I realized those slow,
                cumbersome trading processes wouldn’t last. I envisioned how trading would change until I had a chance
                to change it myself as an entrepreneur. High-speed computers, real-time data and networks, trading and
                execution software and algorithms, and new alternative markets were the enablers and results of the
                transformation.</p>

            <p>I moved from trading to designing and selling trading technology and services before traders were made
                largely obsolete by algorithms and digital disruption. My trading experience helped me develop
                innovations in real-time systems, datafeeds, applications, and services that turned art of the possible
                into cost-effective reality. That digital disruption and proliferation of new electronic markets spread
                worldwide, transforming 200 years of financial market history and rendering large trading floors
                unnecessary for both financial institutions and exchanges.</p>

            <p>Two of my companies designed and built the trading and market data distribution systems that changed Wall
                Street to make it highly automated and real-time. Previously stereotyped and forgotten mathematicians
                and software engineers became highly compensated “quants", “data scientists", and new members of the
                cool crowd. They translated analytically grounded trading strategies into applications and algorithms
                that beat the market, executed by high-speed computers and networks.</p>

            <p>A close partnership formed between Wall Street and the computer and networking companies leading the
                global speed and performance race competing for the last microsecond. Wall Street embraced any
                innovation that created competitive advantages, and investment banks often invested in the companies
                delivering those innovations. My companies integrated state-of-the-art hardware, software, data, and
                networks into trading and data distribution systems we installed on trading floors worldwide.</p>

            <p>By the 1990s every high-performance IT vendor had dedicated sales teams focused on Wall Street and
                financial services (FS). They wanted the revenue but also the drug-like high from winning Wall Street
                market share they leveraged in national and international marketing campaigns. In those days real drugs
                could also play a role in how those Wall Street sales were won given their pervasiveness in the
                financial industry.</p>

            <p>I developed close relationships with senior trading and IT executives on Wall Street and Silicon Valley
                who often helped me, especially at my smaller entrepreneurial companies. They introduced me to decision
                makers I didn’t know when pursuing a big sale, and I reciprocated when I could and frequently treated
                them to great dinners, shows, concerts, and nights out on the town. I became more visible in the press
                than anyone else in capital markets IT, and that media visibility enhanced my credibility with clients
                and influence signing strategic partners.</p>

            <p>Wall Street digital innovations and real-time data spread to other industries as the enabling
                technologies matured and prices decreased. Vivek Ranadive, one of my former trading system competitors,
                led cross-industry adoption by evangelizing the “real-time enterprise” using the slogan “the power of
                now” after founding TIBCO. Later in my career I also moved beyond financial services to lead global
                outsourcing, managed services, and software process automation and AI across industries. But the origins
                traced back to the real-time algorithms and digital disruption of Wall Street and exchanges.</p>

            <p>The trading floor gave me an adrenaline rush from my first exposure as a recent college graduate. I
                wouldn’t have lasted long as an office worker but almost went into music full time. I began playing
                professionally when I was 15, met a lot of girls, and made plenty of money that helped pay Duke tuition
                when my family couldn’t have afforded it. Even during college I was still considering a performing and
                recording career but my Warner Elektra demo record was stagnating. For some combination of insufficient
                talent and bad timing – disco was the new genre and I was a rocker – I accepted a job at a big bank. But
                I wasn’t unhappy there and was rethinking everything until I discovered trading.</p>

            <p>Wall Street had to pay top dollar to compensate for the extreme mental and physical stress and pressure,
                and retaining people was difficult because other firms were always hiring good talent and headhunters
                circled like sharks. Everybody successful on Wall Street regardless of role or level had valuable and
                scarce industry skills which gave them strong cards to play for promotion and advancement. Meanwhile
                recruiters looked for any opportunity to poach good talent.</p>

            <p>Wall Street innovations in trading and new electronic markets made investing cheaper and more accessible
                for everyone, and retail investors soon stopped having to pay trading commissions. Digital and
                regulatory transformation made institutional trading and investing more liquid, more anonymous, and
                resulted in better prices and trade executions that benefitted both retail and institutional investors.
            </p>

            <p>Wall Street money also sponsored charitable events that raised millions for worthy causes, characterized
                by donors as “giving back” for their own good fortune. But it often seemed the charitable cause was
                secondary to rich and successful people partying together. I went to dozens of “charity galas” and award
                ceremonies “honoring” whoever had donated the most money to the cause that year, costing me thousands of
                dollars for a table. Like luxury retailers charities were another beneficiary of the broader Wall Street
                and capital markets ecosystem of money and wealth.</p>

            <p>Wall Street success wasn’t meant to be equal but earned through measurable performance excellence.
                Performing in bands on stage helped me develop the skills, personality, and confidence to interact with
                senior executives and traders. In ways my competitors couldn’t I gave clients a taste of cool and
                exclusive restaurants and nightlife in New York, Chicago, London, Tokyo, Sydney, Hong Kong, and other
                global hotspots. A great dinner and drinks were a given, but for many of my clients the night was just
                beginning after dinner.</p>

            <p>I took them to hot restaurants, clubs, and bars few knew about and even fewer could get into, part of the
                client socialization game as I played it. I took them to sold out Broadway shows, museum openings,
                private suites at concerts and sporting events, or even a high-end strip club if a client was so
                inclined. I played any cards I had to win deals but always played by the rules without stepping over
                admittedly gray lines. During the '80s and '90s there were few if any real lines except money changing
                hands, and rules and policies changed I had to change too but everybody had less fun.</p>

            <p>Today’s highly restrictive rules for business socialization often result in inferior business outcomes,
                sacrificing the strategic alignment and innovative new ideas that came from more relaxed out-of-office
                dialogue. Personal relationships that developed certainly made business more fun and productive for
                everybody, and I never saw any abuse or corruption. Now extreme restrictions on permissible types of
                client entertainment and cost caps can make a Chick-fil-A meal with a Cookies & Cream milkshake look
                like a decent option.</p>

            <p>I led different types of innovation in ways few others ever get to, sometimes with my own ideas and
                sometimes making the ideas of others real. Wall Street was the ultimate risk/reward culture where target
                ROI could be realized in a single lucrative trade or by avoiding a big risk or mistake. Identifying
                business inefficiencies and challenges, applying critical thinking and problem solving, and
                understanding what cutting-edge technologies and services could do were core skills. That along with a
                deep understanding of trading and capital markets led to my new product and service innovation ideas.
            </p>

            <p>After the digital transformation of Wall Street in the late 1980s the marginally controlled trading floor
                chaos I loved was replaced by computers, networks, datafeeds, real-time application software, and
                algorithms running in an equipment room. There were many fewer traders, shrinking trading floors, and
                legacy exchanges were fighting for survival against new market entrants introducing new trading methods.
                Now the action was in the flashing lights and perpetual hum of high-speed computers and specialized
                cooling systems in equipment rooms. Computers were faster, mostly smarter, could analyze infinitely more
                prices and markets simultaneously, and made fewer mistakes than human traders. The computers also didn't
                drink or do drugs, complain, screw the employees, succumb to stress requiring pharmaceuticals or
                therapy, or get paid millions in salary and bonus only to still want more.</p>

            <p>Wall Street and global capital markets operated at a pace and with pressures few people could conceive of
                or endure, but some people thrived in the adrenaline-fueled lifestyle if you avoided too many crutches.
                Weed and alcohol had long been part of the Wall Street scene, but the surge of cocaine usage in the
                1980s was different and I saw it ruin lives. The financial and personal rewards working on Wall Street
                were diverse and many but came at a cost. I was lucky the 1980s ended because constant travel, extreme
                stress and pressure, drugs and alcohol, and partying most every night into the early morning hours were
                taking a physical and mental toll on me too.</p>

            <p>By 2000 there were many new alternatives to traditional exchanges like crossing and matching systems and
                “dark pools" that internalized orders. Most provided better prices, greater anonymity, and more
                transparent liquidity which led to better execution prices on large trades like those of big
                institutional investors and funds. High-frequency and algorithmic trading expanded from stocks into
                bonds, derivatives, commodities, and foreign exchange. Trades were now executed by software and “smart
                algorithms” on fast, liquid electronic markets competing for order flow. For high frequency arbitrage
                traders and market makers milliseconds of speed difference meant low risk trading profits.</p>

            <p>Trading was a nonstop IT arms race for more speed, and specialized hardware, software, data, and services
                vendors sold Wall Street the means to compete and win. Everybody profited, some more than others.
                Digital transformation and algorithmic trading meant tighter spreads, better trade executions, better
                risk management, and improved investor reporting and regulatory compliance. Both institutional and
                retail investors benefitted from better execution prices, and retail brokerage commissions became a
                thing of the past.</p>

            <p>The stately marble environs of the NYSE or the amphitheater “trading pits" of the Chicago commodity and
                options exchanges became expensive liabilities. Big trading floors were good TV sets for shows like
                CNBC’s Squawk on the Street where I was often interviewed, but nothing significant happened on exchange
                trading floors any longer after trading and market making was automated. The cost of maintaining trading
                floors and legacy manual processes diverted investment from innovation and growth, and new alternative
                exchanges took significant market share from traditional exchanges. The innovators expanded into new
                geographies, traded more asset classes electronically for longer hours, and prospered while legacy
                exchanges that didn’t adapt either died or were acquired by the winners.</p>

            <p>Even my former client NYSE was ultimately acquired by my new startup client that our project team brought
                into existence, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). NYSE ignored competitive threats for too long and
                failed in attempts to transform their IT environment and develop a credible growth strategy. The need
                for investment capital to fund growth, forge alliances, and make acquisitions was why most private
                member-owned exchanges had long since become public companies. NYSE leadership ignored my advice for too
                long and found themselves unable to compete with aggressive European exchanges and new alternative
                markets.</p>

            <p>After resigning from Accenture disliking cultural changes post-IPO I worked independently for a few years
                before joining KPMG and leading Intelligent Automation. It gave me a chance to make my new ideas about
                using software process automation and AI to drive innovation and operational efficiency beyond the caps
                of global outsourcing. But after going back to work I found business had changed and not for the better.
            </p>

            <p>The preference-free meritocracy of Andersen Consulting and Accenture had given way to unearned
                institutionalized preferences and diversity goals. Goals became de facto became mandates for quotas in
                hiring, promotions, and compensation. I didn’t like it nor did high performers losing out to identity
                group members with inferior qualifications and performance metrics. Business outcomes suffered and top
                leadership was too isolated from employees doing the work to see realities. They believed the empty
                corporate platitudes HR promoted to respond to bias-influenced pressures, but the result was that new
                hire skill levels declined and high performers who didn’t fit in a preferred identity group resigned.
            </p>

            <p>I had a front row seat to the separation of Andersen Consulting (AC) from Arthur Andersen (AA) and our
                global re-branding as Accenture preceding the blockbuster IPO. I’ll share the inside story of how we won
                the right to separate from AA and previously untold stories of intrigue and political maneuvering along
                the way. Billions of dollars were at stake, and the story of how we executed a global re-branding and
                IPO little more than 2 months before the 9/11 terrorist attacks will be on business school curriculums
                for many years.</p>

            <p>The arbitration ruling freeing Andersen Consulting to become a separate company, the global name change
                to Accenture, and an IPO all in little more than a year was one of the most complex and highest value
                global business transformations ever undertaken. You’ll hear about the Andersen Worldwide global
                partners meeting in Paris where our future was decided and our internal strategy to prevail in the
                International Chamber of Commerce arbitration. I saw it all as the global client partner for our lead
                investment banker Goldman Sachs and as the capital markets managing partner on the investor roadshow
                marketing Accenture IPO shares to big institutional investors.</p>

            <p>I was in New York City on 9/11 and survived against the odds despite my Accenture practice hosting a
                market data conference that morning at Windows on the World. I’ll tell the story of how I survived while
                hundreds of colleagues, clients, and friends at the conference and working in the towers didn’t. Windows
                on the World was on the 106th floor of One World Trade Center, and nobody escaped from up there. My son
                Parker was only 1 year old on 9/11 and could have easily grown up without a father, all because Islamic
                terrorists wanted to kill people just going to work clueless about their bullshit cause or grievance.
            </p>

            <p>In the weeks after 9/11 Accenture helped clients and the city of New York recover even as we dealt with
                our own personal and professional losses. The area’s telecommunications and network infrastructure was
                destroyed in lower Manhattan, and the global financial industry would break down without communication
                links between New York and the rest of the world reestablished. Nothing was ever the same afterwards,
                even getting through building security to meet with clients. The events of 9/11 prompted me to leave New
                York and move to South Carolina in 2003, but I still flew to NY or somewhere in the world every week.

            <p>Wall Street in the '80s and '90s was wilder than even the most sensationalist books and movies portray,
                but I managed to survive and thrive in it. I was truly life in the fast lane but also a once in 100-year
                period of innovation, market disruption, and the transformation of trading, capital markets, and
                professional services. It created lucrative careers on Wall Street and in the ecosystem around it if you
                were good enough and handled the pressure. Anyway, here’s my story…</p>
